# Variable
        #variable names are case sensitive
        # A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        
        # Casting
        # If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

        # Example
        # x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
        # y = int(3)    # y will be 3
        # z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

        # You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
        # x = 5
        # y = "John"
        # print(type(x))
        # print(type(y))


        #x = y = z = "Orange" possible
        # fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        # x, y, z = fruits
        # print(x)
        # print(y)
        # print(z)

        # global variables
        #  If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

        # def myfunc():
        # global x
        # x = "fantastic"

        # myfunc()
