# Variable
        #variable names are case sensitive
        # A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        
        # Casting
        # If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

        # Example
        # x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
        # y = int(3)    # y will be 3
        # z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

        # You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
        # x = 5
        # y = "John"
        # print(type(x))
        # print(type(y))


        #x = y = z = "Orange" possible
        # fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        # x, y, z = fruits
        # print(x)
        # print(y)
        # print(z)

        # global variables
        #  If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

        # def myfunc():
        # global x
        # x = "fantastic"

        # myfunc()


# python data types

# Text Type:	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	dict
# Set Types:	set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	bool
# Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type:	NoneType


        # There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

                # List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
                # Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
                # Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
                # Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.


        #LISTS

        # appened , insert , extend
        # remove pop del clear
        # in for while comprehension
        #List comprehension
        # list.sort()
        # list.sort(reverse = true) // descending order
        # list.reverse()  //reverse the original list
        # newlist = list.copy()
        # newlist = list(thislist)
        # newlist = list1+ list2


        # append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
        # clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
        # copy()	Returns a copy of the list
        # count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
        # extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
        # index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
        # insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
        # pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
        # remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
        # reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
        # sort()	Sorts the list


#tuples

        # Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
        # len(thistuple)
